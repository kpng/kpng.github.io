        <strong class="my-strong">Fantastic Mr. Fox</strong> is on the
        run! 
        The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat
        Boggis, squat Bunce,
        and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and
        his family surrounded.
        What they don't know is that they're not dealing with just
        any fox â€“ Mr. Fox
        would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever
        can save him now.
